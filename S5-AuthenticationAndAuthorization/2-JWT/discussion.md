HTTP is stateless
- Req and response cycle are indpendent of each other
- Give you flexibility to maintain sessions
- Each request we can share some token
- Who generates the token
    - Server
- Client should store it somewhere


- Token
    - Help me identify a unique user in the system
    - Some kind of expiry
    - Token should have nformation related to user
    - Server should own the generation of token (Token Authority)

Approch 1: A token table with all the tokens at one place
- Store
- Scalability: Data could grow quickly
- Availability: 
- Additional DB Call(s)  
- Security
- Expiry: Banking --> 30 minutes, Instagram --> 30 days

Aproach 2: Use Cryptography
    - Expiry
    - Uniquely identify a user
    - Generated by the same system

JWT (JSON Web Token)
Headers
- Algo used
- token type etc
Paylod 
- All user information
- exipry

Signature
Hash (Header, payload, Private Key owned by the server)



What if the private key is stolen? 
Change private key (Key rotation)

ABC ==> K1
XYZ ==> K2

K1, K2 (new) (30 days)
